### 🏛️ Manifesto: From Duality to Creation

In the vast agora of digital development, where lines of code weave the invisible reality, I present not merely a collection of projects, but a declaration of principles. This space is the reflection of a **living identity**, a dialectical balance between two forces that, rather than opposing, converge to elevate the final work.

#### 🔵🔴 The Republic of Identity: Harold and Arturo

Like the myth of the winged chariot, my professional practice is guided by two charioteers, each essential for the journey:

- **<span style="color: #3f80ff">Harold (The Blue)</span>**: Represents the human _Ethos_. It is the free spirit, the empathy necessary to understand that behind every screen there is a human being feeling, waiting. It is fluidity, the creativity born of freedom and closeness.
- **<span style="color: #f15976">Arturo (The Red)</span>**: Embodies the engineering _Logos_. It is the rigorous mind, the Spartan discipline that admits no error in structure. It is the unwavering seriousness before critical architecture, the firmness that sustains the digital building.

Both converge in the **White**, symbol of synthesis and silent homage to my roots in the **Dominican Republic**. I carry my flag in the very syntax of my work: Passion (Red), Liberty (Blue), and Salvation (White).

#### 🧬 The Automaton and the Divine Spark

Observe the background of this portfolio. It is not a mere aesthetic artifice, but the representation of **Conway's Game of Life**.

Why does it lie here? Because it is the supreme metaphor of my vocation: **Artificial Intelligence and Automation**. Just as in Conway's universe, where simple rules engender infinite complexities and unpredictable patterns, my labor is to be the demiurge who orchestrates autonomous systems.

I do not build static software; I sow logical seeds that germinate, grow, and evolve. Order emerges from algorithmic chaos, and in that emergence resides the beauty of our profession.

### 👋 Hi, I'm Harold (and Arturo)

Thanks for taking the time to read this and review my code!

This project is the source code for my interactive CV and personal website. I've put a lot of care into building a modern, scalable, and performant architecture that reflects my technical skills and attention to detail.

## 🛠️ How it's built

This project is a modern **Single Page Application (SPA)** (with Server Side Rendering thanks to Next.js) that uses the latest technologies in the React ecosystem:

### Core

- **[Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router):** Leveraging the latest React Server Components features for optimal performance.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** To ensure robust, maintainable, and type-safe code.
- **[React 19](https://react.dev/):** Using the newest APIs.

### UI & User Experience

- **[Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For an agile and highly customizable design system.
- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/):** Accessible base components (headless UI) to ensure the web is usable by everyone.
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/):** Clean and consistent iconography.
- **Animations & Interactivity:**
  - **Conway's Game of Life** implementation on HTML5 Canvas for a dynamic, interactive background.
  - Smooth motions with Framer Motion and CSS transitions.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design:** Clean architecture with reusable components (`shadcn/ui`) and separation of concerns.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Native English and Spanish support using `next-intl`.
- **On-the-fly PDF Generation:** Real-time PDF CV generation using `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- **Data Validation:** Robust forms with `React Hook Form` and `Zod`.
- **3D Graphics:** Lightweight 3D element integration.
